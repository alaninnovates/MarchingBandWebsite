				The marching band community is a welcoming one, and anyone who joins soon becomes a part of
				our diverse and supportive student network. Through band, students are able to bond with
				each other via rehearsals, retreats, and our many events over the course of the season. They
				not only develop instrumental skills, but also learn the importance of teamwork, as well as
				what it takes to produce an entire field show. (Plus, youâ€™ll get some PE credit* out of it!)
